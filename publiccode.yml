    longDescription: |
      CRITERIA-3D is a three-dimensional water balance for small catchments.


      It includes a numerical solution for three-dimensional water and heat 
      flow in the soil, coupled surface and subsurface flow, meteorological 
      data interpolation, radiation budget, crop development and crop water 
      uptake. It needs hourly meteo data as input (air temperature, 
      precipitation, solar irradiance, air relative humidity, wind speed). See
      [CRITERIA3D
      paper](https://github.com/ARPA-SIMC/CRITERIA3D/blob/master/DOC/CRITERIA3D.pdf)
      for more information.


      ### soilFluxes3D library


      agrolib/soilFluxed3D is a numerical solution of flow equations of water
      and heat in the soil, in a three-dimensional domain.


      Surface water flow is described by the two-dimensional parabolic 
      approximation of the St. Venant equation, using Manning’s equation of 
      motion. Subsurface water flow is described by the three-dimensional 
      Richards’ equation for the unsaturated zone and by three-dimensional 
      Darcy’s law for the saturated zone, using an integrated finite  difference
      formulation. The available boundary conditions are surface  runoff,
      culvert runoff, free drainage (lateral or deep) and prescribed  total
      potential.


      Water fluxes equations may be coupled with the heat flux equations,  which
      include diffusive, latent and advective terms. Atmospheric data  (net
      irradiance, air temperature and relative humidity, wind speed)  could be
      used as top boundary conditions.
