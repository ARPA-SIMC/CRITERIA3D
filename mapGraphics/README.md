# MapGraphics
Forked from [raptorswing/MapGraphics](https://github.com/raptorswing/MapGraphics)

A tile-based "slippy map" library written in/for C++/Qt. BSD licensed (see LICENSE). 
It's meant to enable C++/Qt developers to easily add nice, interactive maps to their applications.

## Building
Its only dependency is Qt. If you're on a system with recent Qt libraries and a good C++ compiler, this should build.

If you're using QtCreator, just open the .pro file and build it. If you're on a command line, run qmake on the .pro file, then make.

## Software

- [PRAGA](https://github.com/ARPA-SIMC/PRAGA)
- [CRITERIA 1D-GEO](https://github.com/ARPA-SIMC/CRITERIA1D)
