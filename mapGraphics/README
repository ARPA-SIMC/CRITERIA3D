A tile-based "slippy map" library written in/for C++/Qt. BSD licensed (see LICENSE). 
It's meant to enable C++/Qt developers to easily add nice, interactive maps to their applications.

Its only dependency is Qt. If you're on a system with recent Qt libraries and a good C++ compiler, this should build.

If you're using QtCreator, just open the .pro file and build it. If you're on a command line, run qmake on the .pro file, then make.

MapGraphics library is used by [CRITERIA-3D](https://github.com/ARPA-SIMC/CRITERIA3D) and [PRAGA](https://github.com/ARPA-SIMC/PRAGA)
